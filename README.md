# Pomodoro-Timer
This Pomodoro timer follows the popular 'Pomodoro Technique' : The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks

This stopwatch will give the user some control over the traditional pomodoro technique, which is 25 minutes work, and 5 minutes break. 
The user is given the ability to manipulate the length off the work period, and break times, in essence this will allow the users to create there own custom workflow.
